# Uhm, dotfiles.

**this is a work in progress**

Long Story Short...WSL2 gave up on me.

But I love the experience of rebuilding this repo. I thought I'd just create a dotfiles folder so I dont have to spend so much time setting my development environment.

**Setup**

Make sh files executable

      chmod 755 install.sh

Run scripts in this order:

- `install.sh`
- `node-install.sh`
