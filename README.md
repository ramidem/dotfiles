# Uhm, ~~`dotfile`~~ config files

I just got my first ever [üçé Mac](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)!

## Step 1

Update...

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make`.

### Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpro/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```
