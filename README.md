# Uhm, dotfiles.

**this is a work in progress**

Long Story Short...WSL2 gave up on me and I don't have the energy and time to figure out what happened.

I am loving the experience of setting up this repo, so far. Although, I am not sure if I really want to stick with Neovim as my code editor. But, we'll see. Pop OS is poppin' too.

**Feel free to check this out**

Preferrably, you'd want to clone this to `~/dotfiles`. But feel free to do it however you like.

      $ git clone https://github.com/ramidem/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

Make the script executable.

      $ chmod 755 install.sh
      $ ./install.sh

I don't know why it's `755` either. But, here you go. [explanation](https://askubuntu.com/questions/932713/what-is-the-difference-between-chmod-x-and-chmod-755#:~:text=So%20chmod%20755%20is%20like,%3Drwx%2Cgo%3Drx%20.&text=is%20not%20useful-,Show%20activity%20on%20this%20post.,users%20to%20the%20existing%20permissions.&text=755%20means%20full%20permissions%20for,and%20execute%20permission%20for%20others.)

Do the same with `node-install.sh` to install the latest nodejs and npm with NVM.
